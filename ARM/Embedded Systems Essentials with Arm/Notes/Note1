By the end of Module 1, you will be able to explain the characteristics of an embedded system and evaluate its benefits and challenges.   

In order to achieve this, you will need to be able to: 

- Explain an embedded system, its components, and its applications
- Compare and contrast a CPU, an MCU, and an embedded system
- Explain the role of embedded systems in the Internet of Things (IoT) and the context of ubiquitous computing
- Identify the challenges of incorporating embedded devices into IoT systems
- Explain the benefits of microcontroller-based embedded systems
- Identify important trade-offs of embedded systems, such as cost and performance
- Identify the characteristics of Arm architecture and processors as core embedded systems components for the IoT.
